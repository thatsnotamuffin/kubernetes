# Scripts
Some of these scripts are used to "automate" slightly longer commands in the spirit of lazy. Most notably the `pod_exec.sh` - `pod_describe.sh` - `pod_log.sh` - `deploy_scale.sh` scripts. Currently these are used as aliases to shorten the need for typing and preserve delicate finger life

```txt
alias kscale='/home/thatsnotamuffin/scripts/deploy_scale.sh'
alias kexec='/home/thatsnotamuffin/scripts/pod_exec.sh'
alias klog='/home/thatsnotamuffin/scripts/pod_log.sh'
alias kdpod='/home/thatsnotamuffin/scripts/pod_describe.sh'
```
